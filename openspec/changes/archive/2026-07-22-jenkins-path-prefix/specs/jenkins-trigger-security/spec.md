## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Internal Jenkins Communication Is Authenticated
The Django application SHALL communicate with the internal Jenkins service using
authenticated requests — a username and password (`JENKINS_SERVER_USER` /
`JENKINS_SERVER_PASS`) — and SHALL supply a CSRF crumb for build requests via a
`CrumbRequester`. This applies to all Django→Jenkins paths: triggering an action, and the
synchronous create/delete network jobs. The internal base URL SHALL target the Jenkins
service under its `/jenkins` context path (e.g. `http://jenkins:8080/jenkins`).

All Jenkins communication SHALL still originate from the Django application container to the
internal Jenkins service, never from the client browser directly.

#### Scenario: Trigger uses authenticated Jenkins client with a crumb
- GIVEN a valid NITA session and configured Jenkins credentials
- WHEN POST /api/v1/networks/{id}/trigger/{action_id}/ is called
- THEN the Django backend authenticates to Jenkins with username/password
- AND a CSRF crumb is obtained before the build is invoked
- AND the Jenkins job is invoked successfully

#### Scenario: Create/delete jobs use the authenticated Jenkins server
- GIVEN configured Jenkins credentials
- WHEN a network create or delete runs the `network_template_mgr` job
- THEN the job is submitted through the authenticated Jenkins server
- AND anonymous (credential-less) submission is not used

#### Scenario: Internal base URL includes the /jenkins prefix
- GIVEN Jenkins serves under the `/jenkins` context path
- WHEN the Django Jenkins client constructs `JENKINS_SERVER_URL`
- THEN the base URL includes the `/jenkins` path prefix (e.g. `http://jenkins:8080/jenkins`)

#### Scenario: Container startup scripts use the prefixed base URL
- GIVEN Jenkins serves under the `/jenkins` context path
- WHEN the webapp entrypoint runs its Jenkins readiness gate and job bootstrap (`ping_jenkins.py`, `configure_jenkins.py`, `add_jenkins_job.py`)
- THEN each script targets `http://jenkins:8080/jenkins` and the startup gate succeeds so Django boots
